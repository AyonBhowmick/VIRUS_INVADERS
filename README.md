# VIRUS_INVADERS
VIRUS INVADERS is a 2D OpenGL game developed in C++ where players combat viruses in a park environment using sanitizer spray. This project demonstrates computer graphics concepts with interactive gameplay.


Game Overview
1. Objective: Protect yourself from incoming viruses by spraying them with sanitizer
2. Environment: Rendered park with pathways, flowers, and bushes
3. Progression: 5 increasingly difficult levels with narrowing paths
4. Scoring: Earn points by eliminating viruses and collecting health packs life. It is setting max 3.

Technical Implementation
1.Built With:OpenGL for 2D graphics rendering
2.GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) for window management
3.C++ for game logic and mechanics
4.Windows Multimedia API for sound effects
